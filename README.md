# 05-DayPlanner

Using the existing HTML and CSS, I created new elements in a loop with the attribute tags that would offer a time, a comment section, and a save button.

The current date is listed at the top with the time slots changing colors depending on the time of the day and whether they are past, present or future.

The comments should save to local storage.
